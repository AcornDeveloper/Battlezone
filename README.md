Battlezone takes place on a large, flat moonscape containing a number of geometrical obstacles with a crescent earth, distant mountains and an erupting volcano.        

The various geometrical obstacles cannot be destroyed but can provide cover for you and enemy alike, some objects do not.     
 
Enemies appear on the battlefield and, with the help of a radar display and screen messages, you seek out and destroy them.

Saucers on the battlefield do not fire on players and do not appear on the radar.                                            

As players successfully destroy opponents the game increases in speed and difficulty with faster tanks and homing missiles.

Players can only take one shot at a time, so time all your shots well.                                                    
# Build Tools required ( PC )

To build the game you first need to install the following tools:-

* [beebasm](https://github.com/stardot/beebasm)

# Build Steps ( PC )

Two batch files for build/build and run point at assembler and resources. These will need amending to point to the source locations when you have downloaded them.

# Additional Notes
